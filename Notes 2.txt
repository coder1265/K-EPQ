3 main breakpoints for my website are 425px, 768px, and 1024px.

For responsive design on my website footer (as it currently wasn't responsive) i implimented a min-max fucntion (changes number of grid collumns based on screen size) and a media query to change the font size of the footer text.
i found this link "https://css-tricks.com/intrinsically-responsive-css-grid-with-minmax-and-min/" this link led to "https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/"
and this link "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp" helpful examples also it has portrait / landcape media querie examples.
This didn't exctly break at the breakpoints i wanted as it broke at 432, 864, and 1296px
If i wanted exact breakpoints i would have to use media queries instead of the minmax function.

I also tweaked the accordion section. and the main image grid
Furthermore i decided to change the resource dropdown to a colapaseable side nav to do so i:
added a link to the nav menus and the content was "&#9776;" which is the hamburger icon (3 horizontal lines)
added a new div with the class "sidenav" and added the links to the resources in it

Using 2 site for svgs (found from folling a tutorial on how to use curves in a website - fireship)
    https://www.shapedivider.app/ - Simple curve SVG
    https://app.haikei.app/ - complex SVG

Also found this site (https://app.svgator.com/#/) however it doesn't provide required functinality so not used.
