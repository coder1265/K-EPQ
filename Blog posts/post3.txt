<h3>New Cage planned</h3>
<p>
We have planned to make a new cage for our chickens so we can split them up
so they each have more space and less crowded conditions this will improve 
their well being
</p>
<p>
Another project we are considering is getting an portable electric fence
as this would then ensure portability to enable access to fresh pastures and
greatly increase the amout of space (far larger than any cage we currently have)
however this will not be as secure so their is increased risk and this is why we 
have decided that it will need to be electric.
