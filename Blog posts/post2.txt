We have recently purchased 30 new chickens for our farm!<br>
15 of these are burford brown chickens, which are known for their high quality egg production and friendly temperament. <br>
The other 15 are Dekalb white chickens, which are known for their high egg production and hardiness although they are very active. <br>
