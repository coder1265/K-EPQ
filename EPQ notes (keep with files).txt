IMPORTAINT
Keep this file near the other code files as this should contain a reference of links and reaserch to do with the site.

Note: for much of my project i have been using mdn(developer.mozilla.org) as this is a very informative and reliable source although it is a not-for-profit website. And relys upon community(web developers / internet users) participation to expand and improve the documetation(so may not be 100% accurate although extensively checked).
Note: For some of my prodject i have used a different device to my school one as they can access DevTools (a google crome built in feature to aid in web development, which is blocked on school devices). This then was used to develop and debug existing code. I also implimented a versioning stratagy which consisted of me sending emails between my school device and my other device to share the work (switching between the devices used for work at school and at home.)

I have seen on some websites a headbar that dissapears on scrolling and would like to impliment my version on my site. To do this i had to reaserch the "scroll" event which is triggered every time i scroll on my page (the link used is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event). I implimented this on the window object with an event litener "window.addEventListener("scroll", scrollFuntion);". This executed the function on every scroll so then i reaserched the "window.scrollY" property (again i used mdn https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollY) to be able to determine how much the user has scrolled. Then i searched how to control the throtle of the event (basicly when a user scrolls to fast it can cause unusual behaviour) so i found this site (https://johnkavanagh.co.uk/articles/throttling-scroll-events-in-javascript/) whick explained the basics but was try to convince me to use a public code libary called lodash (which i didn't). I then implimented these all together to make the quick contact section disappear when the user scrolls so much. 

Next i made the footer accorning to a basic sketch, i had decided on using the grid method for positioning. becuase the grid property is complex and i haven't fully learnt it then i used a webiste i had used before (https://grid.malven.co/) this is a business web development site ( i beleieve the resoucre was made to attract customers / developers to their website) that has a list of properties for the grid container and items (there also is another usefull page called https://flexbox.malven.co/ that i have previously used for flexbox). 

Then i fixed a few minor bugs and changeded a few settings (changes main image from position relative to css grid which i used "grid.malven.co"). After that i focused on the products section of the main page (i tried to copy a product card style) and after seeing example of product card from "https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_product_card.asp" then i foled my plan of using 3 cards in this section after adding some of the code it looked like screenshot "EPQ progress 2025-05-22.png". Then after taking a few images and selecting some images for the products. i also added some small css(styling) corrections.

Then i started work on the news/blog section, i had decided against my original idea of useing cards again and instead decided on accordions as it doesnt make the design look reptative. to do so i reasrech accordions (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) then made some div's and the respecitve css and JS (i reaslised the examples JS is more effient than how i would do it so i coppied the code with a few minor tweaks to my code). I then added some content(more needs to be added later)

After this then i started work on the about page (copying accross the header and footer from index.html) following the design i made 2 sections on containing contemnt about us and the other section showcaseing some of our chickens.For the first seciton i used 2 div with flex settings (i use flex.malven.co again for those) and in each of contained a image (i used the logo as a placeholder until i get the photos) then opposite from it was sometext about lancaster produce(my egg hobby i am building this website for). (see EPQ progress 24-05-25 screenshot).

Then i moved on to the contact page, coppying the headers and footer across from the other pages i have made, and built 2 sections, the first is a form that should send a email to us (a haven't figgured out that part without using the clients mailing system) and the second section is a map and address to our location allowing for own collection. To build the first section is looked up (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form) as a good starting point and then used (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp) as an example of how it should be. Whilest building the form i used (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input) to help style the inputs and add email adress validation, i used (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) to try and enable the form to be autocompleted. To add some security (athough by no means secure) i used advice from (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation).

For the second section (our location i found this link https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map#:~:text=your%20web%20page:-,Get%20an%20API%20key,libraries%22%2C%5B...) which while usefull and potentialy better the method was too complex so i went for a simpler and more achivable option explained by this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi1_BFQcClQ) which was to embed an google iframe with our location on it. After adding a few styles i then moved onto making the form send emails.

To make the form send emails i serched "how to make a form send email with no server side code" this led me to emailJS which i found a tuorial on (https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=BgVjild0C9A) and followed the steps. this led to my emails not sending and having a few error so i double checked (which didn't result in any changes) and then on the email js website i found a trial sample of code (which worked) i then implimented(mainly copied) this code. Though the only significanly differnet piece of code was the javascript (see sendEmail.js) although this gave me errors as for some reason it was parsed before the content (to fix i found that the getElementById was returning null and therefor i added "document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {" this sorted the problem and then i styled the form.


My site wasn't realy responsive so then hound this link (https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-create-responsive-website#:~:text=Use%20a%20Fluid%20Grid%20Layout,user%2Dfriendly%20on%20all%20devices.) which is a article for responsive web design. 

To enhance my basic knowlegd i searched "web dev best pracitices" which led me to these links (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup and https://web.dev/learn). I satared reading these articles (although some of them cover what i know this recaps my udnerastanding ans there are some sections that i have missed).
