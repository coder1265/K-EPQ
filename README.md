# K-EPQ

My EPQ static site for selling eggs
Would have login feature (however no server side so not possible)
Color scheme:
#d00 (a dark red) # main red
#0088DE
#DEDB00
#892E2E
#2F4C5E

Alternative to white(#ffffff) is #f5f5f5 as it is less sharp

Suggested improvements:
curvy breaks between sections - try out SGV's
Responsive design
Higher SEO
Add eastereggs such as komani code (added) to make a pop up

On V2 build mobile first then expand rather than condense:
/_ Base styles for mobile first _/

@media (min-width: 600px) {
/_ tablet and up _/
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
/_ desktop and up _/
}

Break points are:
600px,
1024px
