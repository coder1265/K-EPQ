# K-EPQ
My EPQ static site for selling eggs
Would have login feature (however no server side so not possible)
Color scheme:
#d00 (a dark red) # main red
#0088DE
#DEDB00
#892E2E
#2F4C5E

Alternative to white(#ffffff) is #f5f5f5 as it is less sharp

Suggested improvements:
curvy breaks between sections - try out SGV's
a cookie acceptance modal and in bottom left corner to change preferences
Responsive design

On V2 build mobile first then expand rather than condense
